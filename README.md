# PBGnomeBackgrounder

Allows having different backgrounds on each Gnome desktop.
Just launch it and forget it...

To change a background on a desktop, select the desktop and use standard
Gnome tool for changing background (whatever it is).

PBGnomeBackgrounder traps the changes made and register them as the new
background for the desktop.

When you go to new desktop, PBGnomeBackgrounder sees it and restores the
background associated with it. If no one is yet defined, is keeps the current
background.

**NOTE**: It will not work with slide show backgrounds, only still images.
